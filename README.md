=========

A site dedicated to the pig...the bringer of the the bacon! 

The idea is for the user to click/hover on a section of the pig and it will provide a description of the cut and different possible names and prepartions for the cut.  Then if the user wants more information they can click on the pop up and it will use a restaurant and/or recipe API to provide meal ideas for the pork cut.

Hoping to add an interactive part where you can move the different parts of the pig into an empty shell.  I expect to be using JavaScript and JQuery for this part.
